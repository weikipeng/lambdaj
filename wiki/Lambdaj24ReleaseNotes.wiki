#summary New features in lambdaj 2.4

The following new features and improvements have been added with the release 2.4:

*1.* Allow to define a custom strategy to create placeholder for final classes.

As reported by [http://code.google.com/p/lambdaj/issues/detail?id=70 this issue]: "the use of AgumentsFactory.createArgumentPlaceholderForUnknownClass assumes if a constructor with a string or numeric value is located, that the equals - relation will return false" Unfortunately this is not always true as for the case org.joda.time.LocalDate. This improvement allows to overcome this limitation by allowing to register a custom argument creator factory for unknown final class as in the following example:

{{{
    public class LocalDateArgumentCreator implements FinalClassArgumentCreator<LocalDate> {
        private final long MSECS_IN_DAY = 1000L * 60L * 60L * 24L;
        public LocalDate createArgumentPlaceHolder(int seed) {
            return new LocalDate((long)seed * MSECS_IN_DAY);
        }
    }
}}}

having defined this factory you can register it as it follows:

{{{
ArgumentsFactory.registerFinalClassArgumentCreator(LocalDate.class, new LocalDateArgumentCreator());
}}}
