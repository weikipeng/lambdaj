#summary New features in lambdaj 2.4

The following new features and improvements have been added with the release 2.4:

*1. Allow to define a custom strategy to create placeholder for final classes.*

As reported by [http://code.google.com/p/lambdaj/issues/detail?id=70 this issue]: "the use of `AgumentsFactory.createArgumentPlaceholderForUnknownClass` assumes if a constructor with a string or numeric value is located, that the equals - relation will return false" Unfortunately this is not always true as for the case `org.joda.time.LocalDate`. This improvement allows to overcome this limitation by allowing to register a custom argument creator factory for unknown final class as in the following example:

{{{
    public class LocalDateArgumentCreator implements FinalClassArgumentCreator<LocalDate> {
        private final long MSECS_IN_DAY = 1000L * 60L * 60L * 24L;
        public LocalDate createArgumentPlaceHolder(int seed) {
            return new LocalDate((long)seed * MSECS_IN_DAY);
        }
    }
}}}

having defined this factory you can register it as it follows:

{{{
ArgumentsFactory.registerFinalClassArgumentCreator(LocalDate.class, new LocalDateArgumentCreator());
}}}

*2. More precise exceptions (re)throw.*

When a method invoked through a lambdaj proxy throws an Exception it is no longer wrapped inside an `InvocationTargetException`. Now if the original Exception is a Runtime one it is thrown as it is, otherwise it's wrapped inside a `RuntimeExcption` and then rethrown.


*3. Sort options*

2 sort options, DESCENDING and IGNORE_CASE are now available for the lambdaj sorting features, so for example you can write:

{{{
sort(persons, on(Person.class).getAge(), DESCENDING);
}}}

or

{{{
sort(persons, on(Person.class).getFirstName(), IGNORE_CASE);
}}}


Of course you can also combine them: 

{{{
sort(persons, on(Person.class).getFirstName(), IGNORE_CASE + DESCENDING);
}}}

and use them in the lambdaj's fluent interface collections. More options will be possible made available in the future as per lambda's users requests.
