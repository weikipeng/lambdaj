#summary The lambdaj's fluent interface collections

lambdaj's API are designed to be easily combined in a single complex statement as in the following example:

{{{
List<Person> buyersSortedByAgres = sort(
	extract(
		select(sales, not(nullValue())
	), on(Sale.class).getBuyer() 
), on(Person.class).getAge());
}}}

Here a list of Sales is purged from its null values, then from each not null sale is extracted its buyer and in the end the resulting Persons are sorted based on their ages. This single statement looks quite powerful, especially if you compare what you should do to achieve the same result in plain java:

{{{
List<Person> buyersSortedByAgres = new ArrayList<Person>();
for(Sale sale : sales) {
	if (sale != null) {
		buyersSortedByAgres.add(sale.getBuyer());
	}
}
Collections.sort(buyersSortedByAgres, new Comparator<Person>() {
	public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {
	   return p1.getAge() - p2.getAge();
	}
});
}}}

Anyway the lambdaj version could be a bit difficult to be read due to its nested form. That's why the release 2.3 introduced the so called LambdaCollections that allows to use the same features in a more readable way:

{{{
List<Person> buyersSortedByAgres = with(sales)
	.remove(nullValue())
	.extract(on(Sale.class).getBuyer())
	.sort(on(Sale.class).getValue());
}}}

These special collections implements a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface fluent interface] providing a more handy way to employ the lambdaj features. In more details the with() static method wraps a plain list (set, map or array) with the corresponding lambda collection.

Note that the LambdaCollections actually implement the corresponding java interface (i.e. LambdaList implements java.util.List) so you can use them in all other API as usual. This is done by simply delegating to the original wrapped collection for the methods belonging to the base interface, so you don't have to pay any performance penalty.

A special thanks to Gianfranco Tognana who suggested the main ideas and developed part of the implementation of the LambdaCollections.
